                    Born in Pakistan and raised in both the U.K. and California, my life goal has always <br>been to simply change the world
                    for all people.Whether I was walking around my childhood neighborhood collecting large phonebooks for
                    recycling <br> to starting my own rainforest club when
                    I was 11 to save a crocodile I’d fallen in love with;
                    I’ve strived to leave this world better than I found it. <br>

                    <br>

With a background in biology, I’ve dabbled in engineering research to environmental nonprofit
                    work to now human-centered business design.

                    There needs to be a tremendous surge of creativity on a global scale for meaningful change and it all starts with playfulness.
                    <br><b>And I’m here to play.</b></span>
