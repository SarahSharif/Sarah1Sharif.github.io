                    My goal has always been to simply change the world for the best.

                    I’ve directed <a href="http://atxhackforchange.org/">ATX Hack for Change</a>, an annual civic hackathon, here in Austin that launched in 2013. Under my direction, I was energized to take the event to the next level. I feel strongly that there needs to be a tremendous surge of creativity on a global scale for meaningful change and it all starts with playfulness. And I’m here to play.</p>
